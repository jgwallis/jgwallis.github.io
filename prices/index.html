Time-based charges
</h2>
<p id="basic-rate-for-troubleshooting">
From 6th April 2021, my basic rate for computer troubleshooting is
£32 per hour with a minimum chargeable time of
one hour (unless your problem is trivial).
After the first hour, time is charged in quarter-hour chunks, with any
part of a quarter-hour counting as a whole quarter-hour.
</p>
<p id="competitive-rate">
So one-and-a-quarter hours of work is £40,
one hour and twenty-five minutes is £48, and
so on.
This rate is very competitive, being considerably lower than many other
professionals would charge.
Working from home rather than operating from dedicated business premises
allows me to keep my overheads low and provide great value for money.
</p>
<p id="no-callout-fee">
There&rsquo;s no call-out fee for local work. but there&rsquo;s at least a
half-hour charge for any job that&rsquo;s more than five miles from my
home, and this increases if the distance is significantly further.
I have to charge this to account for the time it takes to drive both ways,
fuel, business insurance, and sometimes parking as well.
However, most computer support businesses always charge a call-out fee,
and the only way you can avoid it is by taking your problem to them,
which is often inconvenient.
</p>
<p id="tuition-charges">
Charges for
<a title="Tuition" href="/services/services-tuition/">
tuition</a>
and
<a title="Advice" href="/services/services-advice/">
advice</a>
are lower, because teaching and advising are usually
easier and less stressful than fixing problems.
I can still remember what it was like when I first used a computer in
1977, so I&rsquo;m very understanding and happy to go over things
time and again, explaining them in different ways, until you
understand what&rsquo;s going on.
There&rsquo;s no pressure, and there are no tests.
You will simply end up being able to do what you want to do, without
worry or confusion.

for further details.
</p>
<p id="no-vat">
Please note that there is
<strong>
no Value Added Tax
</strong>
on top of these charges.
</p>
<h2 id="no-fix-no-fee" class="uk-h3">
Limited &lsquo;no fix, no fee&rsquo; policy
</h2>
<p id="cannot-solve-problem">
If I&rsquo;m called out to solve a specific problem and find that I
can&rsquo;t fix it because I&rsquo;m unable to identify the cause,
then I won&rsquo;t charge anything.
However, if I diagnose the cause but cannot fix the problem because
it is practically unfixable, or unreasonable to expect an
independent computer troubleshooter to do so, there will
still be a small diagnosis fee (equivalent to at least
half-an-hour&rsquo;s time).
I&rsquo;ve had to introduce this policy because sometimes a potential
customer would call me out to look at a hopeless case just to get
confirmation that there was nothing that could practically be
done, and I had no realistic prospect of getting paid.
</p>
<p id="asked-not-to-fix-problem">
If I diagnose a problem that I can fix, then a potential customer decides
not to give me a chance to fix the problem, there&rsquo;ll usually be a
small diagnosis fee (equivalent to at least half-an-hour&rsquo;s time).
I&rsquo;ve had to introduce this policy because sometimes a potential
customer would call me out to discover what was wrong with their
computer, then decide to not bother fixing it, or to fix it
themselves, or to get somebody else to fix it, and I would
end up doing a lot of diagnostic work and not getting paid
for it.
</p>
<p id="not-solving-all-problems">
If I&rsquo;m called out to solve a problem and am successful, but am
then asked to look at another problem that I can&rsquo;t solve,
I&rsquo;ll still charge for fixing the initial problem.
I&rsquo;ve had to introduce this policy because sometimes a customer would
be reluctant to pay me anything unless I solved every single problem that
they&rsquo;d raised, however small they were.
</p>
<h2 id="being-reasonable" class="uk-h3">
Being reasonable
</h2>
<p id="small-payments-and-capped-charges">
If you call me out to do a job and it turns out to be very quick and
simple, I&rsquo;ll only ask for a small, reasonable payment.
In other words I never stick rigidly to my normal charges if doing so
would be unfair.
Also, if a job is likely to go on for a very long time, I will almost
always be willing to cap the charge at a mutually agreed maximum.
A lot of my work is repeat business for customers who appreciate my
reasonable approach to charging, so you can call me out without
worrying about how much it&rsquo;s going to cost.
</p>
<p id="i-will-never-get-rich">
When customers ask how much they owe me and I tell them, they sometimes
say &lsquo;is that all?&rsquo;
Another question I hear quite often is &lsquo;are you sure that&rsquo;s
enough?&rsquo;
I always reply &lsquo;yes&rsquo; because I&rsquo;m not someone who goes
back on things.
People sometimes tell me that I&rsquo;m not a very good businessman and
will never get rich, but I already know that.
At heart I&rsquo;m just a &lsquo;techie&rsquo; trying to earn a basic
living without being greedy.
</p>
<h2 id="telephone-advice" class="uk-h3">
Telephone advice
</h2>
<p id="charges-for-telephone-advice">
If you telephone me for advice and I&rsquo;m able to sort out your query
there and then during the call, I&rsquo;ll not charge you anything,
provided the call is only short (less than fifteen minutes long).
However, in the past people have telephoned for ages and expected me to
provide assistance completely free of charge as long as I&rsquo;ve not
had to visit them.
Therefore I&rsquo;ve had to introduce a small charge for taking telephone
calls that go on for more than fifteen minutes.
This amounts to £8 for the initial quarter-hour
plus another £8 for each subsequent
quarter-hour, with any part of a subsequent quarter-hour
counting as a whole quarter-hour.
</p>
<h2 id="e-mail-advice" class="uk-h3">
E-mail advice
</h2>
<p id="charges-for-e-mail-advice">
I&rsquo;m quite happy to provide advice by e-mail, and just as for
telephone advice, there is no charge for small queries.
However, if we end up in a detailed e-mail conversation, I&rsquo;ll have
to make a small charge for the time involved.
Having said that, I&rsquo;ll always warn you if a protracted query has
gone on for so long that I intend to make a charge if it continues.
</p>
<h2 id="payment" class="uk-h3">
Payment
</h2>
<p id="cash-cheque-bacs">
I accept payment in cash, by cheque, or by direct bank transfer (Bacs,
which used to be known as BACS (the Bankers&rsquo; Automated Clearing
Services)).
Having said that, I prefer to avoid handling cheques if possible as
I&rsquo;m no longer able to bank them in Mildenhall due to branch
closure.
Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t have the facility to process credit or debit
card payments, as the overhead would be too much just to handle a small
number of transactions.
</p>
<h2 id="invoices" class="uk-h3">
Invoices
</h2>
<p id="credit-basis">
For regular domestic customers, and businesses, I&rsquo;m happy to operate
on a credit basis where I issue a paper or electronic invoice to be paid
within twenty-eight days.
Of course I&rsquo;m always glad to provide an invoice to any customer who
wants one for their records, though I&rsquo;m unable to provide them
retrospectively (I&rsquo;ve occasionally been asked to provide
backdated invoices months after the relevant events).
