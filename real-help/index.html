service providers, only offer customer support through call centre
hotlines and online chat facilities.
They don&rsquo;t want to deal with letters or e-mails, and they often
don&rsquo;t have enough people working the telephones and chatlines,
so customers end up waiting in long queues.</p><h3 id=talking-to-a-robot class=uk-h4>Talking to a robot</h3><p>In an attempt to shorten chatline queues, while saving money on staff, a
lot of providers have even introduced robotic chatline operators that
try to act like humans, but are actually just machines.
They might work for simple queries, but not for anything complicated.
If you end up talking to one of these &lsquo;chatbots&rsquo; and it
can&rsquo;t solve your problem, you might get put through to a real
person, but it&rsquo;s another obstacle that you have to get past.</p><h2 id=jumping-through-hoops class=uk-h3>Jumping through hoops</h2><h3 id=one-size-fits-all class=uk-h4>One size fits all</h3><p>For a complex issue, it&rsquo;s probably better to telephone, but then
you&rsquo;ll run into several problems.
First you&rsquo;ll get the &lsquo;press &ldquo;1&rdquo; for this and press
&ldquo;2&rdquo; for that&rsquo; problem, which is enough to test
anybody&rsquo;s patience.
Then you&lsquo;ll get the &lsquo;your call is important to us&rsquo;
routine.
When you eventually get to speak to someone, they&rsquo;ll ask you to go
through various standard procedures that they always suggest, many of
which are time-consuming and have virtually no chance of being the
solution to your problem.</p><h3 id=the-same-answers-for-every-problem class=uk-h4>The same answers for every problem</h3><p>Have you done a &lsquo;clean boot&rsquo; of the system?
Have you checked the hard disk drive for errors?
Have you tried backing up all of your data then reinstalling the
operating system?
You have to play along with these suggestions otherwise you&rsquo;re
handing the support people the excuse they need to hang up, but a
lot of their proposals are either steps on the road to nowhere
or &lsquo;sledgehammer to crack a nut&rsquo; solutions.
When your system won&rsquo;t even start up, the last thing you need is
a numbskull suggestion that you run some diagnostic software that
requires the system to be up and running.
Support people often don&rsquo;t think very hard about your particular
problem, they just suggest the same old things as usual and hope for
the best.</p><h2 id=you-have-to-do-the-work class=uk-h3>You have to do the work</h2><p>The reality is that these businesses are no longer interested in taking
responsibility for problems, if they ever were, but want their
customers to do most of the work themselves.
This is not <em>real</em> customer service.
If you take your car to a garage because the engine is making a strange
noise, you don&rsquo;t expect to be directed to an empty corner of the
building and handed a tray of tools to sort out the problem yourself,
but this is how most of the computer industry operates.
In fact the computer industry is worse because quite often, the tools they
offer you don&rsquo;t work and you just end up with useless &lsquo;unable
to solve your problem&rsquo; messages.</p><h2 id=recognise-the-limitations-of-the-system class=uk-h3>Recognise the limitations of the system</h2><p>You can get some basic advice over the telephone or by chatting online, if
you are prepared to wait long enough, but most of the work is pushed onto
the customer.
Making customers jump through a lot of hoops, waste a lot of time, and
take a lot of risks, is an odd way to operate, but unfortunately
that&rsquo;s how the big players in the computer industry work,
and I can&rsquo;t see that changing any time soon.
Fortunately, it is still possible to get real support from people like
me who will solve your problems without expecting you to do the work.</p><h2 id=computers-are-complicated class=uk-h3>Computers are complicated</h2><h3 id=troubleshooting-is-not-easy class=uk-h4>Troubleshooting is not easy</h3><p>I do have a little sympathy for the manufacturers and service providers.
Computers are very complex machines, even if they look simple on the
outside, and there are so many ways of configuring them that
problems can be hard to track down and eventually solve.
Consistency and ease of maintenance is one reason why most large
organisations make sure that all their computers are configured
in exactly the same way.
However, in domestic environments computer set-ups are usually unique.</p><h3 id=problem-solving-is-not-quick class=uk-h4>Problem-solving is not quick</h3><p>Manufacturers and service providers can&rsquo;t afford to spend very long
on each problem that is reported to them because these puzzles are often
difficult and numerous, and in any case, solving them results in little
if any profit.
Fixing domestic computers takes effort, and manufacturers and service providers
generally don&rsquo;t like making an effort.
However, that doesn&rsquo;t really do the customer much good.
Nevertheless, there is an affordable solution.</p><h2 id=the-real-answer class=uk-h3>The real answer</h2><h3 id=find-someone-wholl-actually-do-the-work class=uk-h4>Find someone who&rsquo;ll actually do the work</h3><p>The solution for any customer who wants to get their problems solved
quickly, and properly, is to hire a local expert who&rsquo;ll sort
everything out without any buck-passing.
Engaging someone who&rsquo;ll take responsibility for the problem means
the customer can get on with things as usual and have peace of mind.
So talk to a real computer person, not someone from a call centre who
reads out lists of instructions from a script, often without the
knowledge, skill, or inclination to help further.</p><h3 id=look-at-reliable-online-reviews class=uk-h4>Look at reliable online reviews</h3><p>Finding a reliable computer person isn&rsquo;t hard.
I sometimes see people on Facebook and other websites asking for
recommendations, but the easiest way to find a local
expert is to search Google for something like
&lsquo;<a target=_blank title="Click to search for 'computer problem Mildenhall' on Google" href="https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=computer+problem+Mildenhall">computer problem Mildenhall</a>&rsquo;
or
&lsquo;<a target=_blank title="Click to search for 'laptop trouble Mildenhall' on Google" href="https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=laptop+trouble+Mildenhall">laptop trouble Mildenhall</a>&rsquo;.
You&rsquo;ll find far more opinions by doing this, going back quite a long
time, and they&rsquo;ll be a lot more useful than the &lsquo;I always go
to Fred&rsquo; responses that you&rsquo;re likely to get from social
media.</p><h3 id=choose-someone-who-ranks-highly class=uk-h4>Choose someone who ranks highly</h3><p>In this particular case, my details will probably appear quite near the
top of the first page.
You&rsquo;ll be able to see my reviews on
<a target=_blank title="Click to visit the original source of my FreeIndex reviews" href=https://johnwallis.freeindex.co.uk/>FreeIndex</a>,
<a target=_blank title="Click to visit the original source of my Google reviews" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=john+wallis+mildenhall">Google</a>,
and
<a target=_blank title="Click to visit the original source of my Yell reviews" href=https://www.yell.com/biz/john-wallis-bury-st-edmunds-8093000/>Yell&trade;</a>,
and compare me with local competitors.
It should then be easy to make up your mind who to contact, based on
professionalism, experience, and willingness to turn up and help
without delay.</p><br></div></section><div class=uk-container><section class="uk-section uk-section-small uk-background-cover uk-background-center-center"><footer><div id=footer-container class="uk-container uk-container-small"><div uk-grid class="uk-child-width-expand@s uk-flex-middle uk-grid uk-text-center uk-text-small uk-visible@m jgw-footer"><div class="uk-width-1-2@m uk-text-left uk-first-column"><h5>Copyright &copy; 2021 J.
