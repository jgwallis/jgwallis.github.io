where, on 12th June 2020, I was rated 14th out of 3,903 people in the
&lsquo;UK Computer Service Providers&rsquo; category (putting me just
outside the top 1% nationally and awarding me
&lsquo;<strong>Highly Recommended by FreeIndex Users</strong>&rsquo;
status):</p><br><p>&ldquo;I am normally able to sort out minor computer problems myself.
Unfortunately I had a blue screen with a very loud noise.
I contacted Mr Wallis and left my laptop with him.
I must commend him on a brilliant job.
Not only can I use my laptop again, but it is so much faster than before.
I definitely recommend Mr Wallis if you have computer problems.
&rdquo;</p><p><i>M. N., Freckenham
(Five-star rating awarded 24th February 2017)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John knows what he is doing with all aspects of computer hardware
and software.
He set up my new printer (the instructions were double dutch to me), also
installed a new photo-editing suite and as an extra made it so that I
could use my Kindle which I had not been able to use for ages due to
a change of e-mail address.
I was very pleased and will use him again.&rdquo;</p><p><i>H. S., Mildenhall
(Five-star rating awarded 5th February 2017)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Excellent service!
John fixed my Mac, a HP notebook (Windows) and a printer.
Very decent price for the long repairing time, in my case.
I couldn&rsquo;t be more happier!&rdquo;</p><p><i>F. M., Beck Row
(Five-star rating awarded 4th February 2017)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Excellent service.
Most impressed with the fact that every test was noted for future
reference.
Very patient with attention, collected my PC for repair, returned
promptly, very reasonable charge.
Would recommend services provided.&rdquo;</p><p><i>C. H., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 14th January 2017)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;I have known John Wallis for many years.
He has always responded very promptly &ndash; usually the same day &ndash;
to requests for help with my computer problems, and I have had many!
His advice is clearly expressed in language that is appropriate to my
level of expertise, and he is happy to retrace his advice if it is
apparent that I am still confused!
I recommend him without reservations.&rdquo;</p><p><i>P. B., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 2nd December 2016)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Contacted on Friday, able to visit promptly the next day.
Technical help provided for 2 laptops.
Easily sorted, swift service.
Great value.
Will definitely recommend to friends and seek to use again.&rdquo;</p><p><i>A. T., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 31st October
2016)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;I have known John for several years and I do not hesitate to
contact him whenever I have an IT problem.
He is easily accessible and very prompt in calling round.
He has always resolved the problem quickly and explains it in
layman&rsquo;s terms.
I have also always found him very fair and good value for money.
I have no hesitation in recommending him.&rdquo;</p><p><i>M. F., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 26th July
2016)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John is a man of integrity.
He is extremely knowledgeable about computers and it is clear he keeps up
to date with the latest information and advancements of computer
software.
He fixed the problem easily and efficiently and went beyond the problem to
clean my computer of all of the potential harmful downloads, that I did
not have a clue about!
A lovely gentleman who I would definitely consult in the future for all of
my computer needs.&rdquo;</p><p><i>T. T., Hockwold (Five-star rating awarded 21st
February 2016)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Excellent service.
Understood straight away what was wrong and did not waffle computer
terms &ndash; explained in plain English what was wrong and fixed
the problems straight away &ndash; even improve on them
&ndash; will definitely use again and will recommend
to others.&rdquo;</p><p><i>S. A., Beck Row (Five-star rating awarded 16th February
2016)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;I have used John to fix several problems with my desktops.
He is always very polite, honest and determined to fix the problem.
Always reliable and good value for money.
I would highly recommend him.&rdquo;</p><p><i>A. W., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 16th January
2016)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had John out a couple of times recently to provide
technology assistance and he always works his magic.
Whether it is setting up the wireless system after our house move, keeping
our old Dell laptop humming along or helping my daughter navigate her new
iPad, he does the job.
Obviously, his breadth of knowledge is extensive as there seems to be no
problem he cannot fix and no job he will not tackle.
We are so grateful to have connected with him&mldr;thanks again
John.&rdquo;</p><p><i>G. S., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 14th
January 2016)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;I had a computer that was about fifteen years old and it was
running very slowly, so I called John Wallis for help.
Unfortunately the computer was obsolete, but John helped me to find a new
one running Windows 10 for a very reasonable price and when it arrived he
promptly set it up exactly to my requirements.
Since then I have had no problems, but whenever I have any questions John
is always happy to answer them in an understandable way.
If anyone I know ever has any computer problems, I always recommend they
get in touch with John.&rdquo;</p><p><i>F. P., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 12th December
2015)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John was prompt in answering my plea for help and arrival for the
appointed time.
After doing all of the usual trouble shooting the root of the problem was
not found.
He was very persistent and methodical till he finally found the unusual
cause of my computer trouble.
For a computer that was deemed totally useless, it now performs like new.
I am more than delighted with the service and the cost for his call out.
Will highly recommend.&rdquo;</p><p><i>W. B., Barton Mills (Five-star rating awarded 28th
November 2015)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John has sorted out many problems I have had with my laptop over
the years.
He is extremely knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and always prompt.
I would highly recommend John to anyone with computer problems.&rdquo;</p><p><i>T. B., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 7th
September 2015)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;What I spent eight hours on the phone to BT Indian call centres and
never got a result John was able to fix in ten minutes.
I can&rsquo;t speak anything but the highest praise.&rdquo;</p><p><i>P. H., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 13th May
2015)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John is extremely knowledgeable and personable.
He arrived promptly and was able to remove all the malicious software on
my laptop.
He is competent and has the ability to explain what he is doing in
layman&rsquo;s terms.
I would definitely recommend him.&rdquo;</p><p><i>M. S., West Row (Five-star rating awarded 22nd March
2015)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;I like to fix my own IT problems but this time it was beyond my
skill level.
I phoned John in the morning, explaining the problem with my desktop
computer.
John researched it and visited me the same afternoon.
He was able to fix the main problem, an issue with lost restore dates
which meant I could not access my profile.
He removed unwanted programmes at start up and some other minor issues to
help in running the PC quicker.
He also got my laptop working again following password issues.
He is very knowledgeable, patient and happy to share with you what he is
doing and why.
I can highly recommend John and would use him again with no
hesitation.&rdquo;</p><p><i>J. P., Lakenheath (Five-star rating awarded 1st March
2015)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Trustworthy.
Dependable.
Quietly sorts out the computer problem with ease.
Very generous with technical information.
Patient.
Great value for money.
Highly recommended individual.&rdquo;</p><p><i>J. B., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 25th
February 2015)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;I purchased a new all-in-one PC with Windows 8.1 on it and was
unsure how to transfer all my documents and music over from my old
Windows XP desktop.
I gave John a call and he sounded a nice guy and was very helpful.
He arranged to come over and show me how to transfer the files.
John helped with the transfer and also showed me a number of things with
Windows 8.1 as I had never used it before.
A few days later I was unsure about the settings for having two users on
the computer and sharing files and music and when I spoke to John he had
a look into it and popped around a couple of hours later and sorted it
out.
I would happily recommend John to anyone who needs help with their PC.
Very friendly and helpful.&rdquo;</p><p><i>M. T., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 13th January
2015)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John has helped me a couple of times now &ndash; once visiting me
to help me with my computer and the other giving me advice over the
phone.
Even though it was a weekend he was there to help.
I always keep John&rsquo;s number handy at home!
:).&rdquo;</p><p><i>D. M., Newmarket (Five-star rating awarded 3rd
December 2014)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;We were very pleased with John&rsquo;s prompt response to our
request for help with a problem with our computer and completely
satisfied with the efficient way he solved the problem for us.&rdquo;</p><p><i>R. C., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 1st December
2014)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John has been sorting out my computer for a number of years and I
have found him excellent and would not hesitate to recommend him.&rdquo;</p><p><i>W. H., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 17th
November 2014)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Excellent work from John with annoying problems that I was
experiencing with my computer.
John fixed the problems very quickly and also gave me advice about how to
get the best use from my computer.&rdquo;</p><p><i>M. W., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 12th November
2014)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John Wallis has found solutions for a number of problems I have had
with my laptop and Epson printer.
He has an extensive knowledge of useful programs available on the
Internet.
If he cannot sort a problem immediately he keeps on researching until he
can.
Friendly and prompt service.&rdquo;</p><p><i>A. L., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 1st November
2014)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;I would highly recommend John to anyone with any computer problem.
He is punctual, efficient and friendly.
John has now designed a Web site for my driving school business, advising
me and spending time over the design and text.
The Web site is now up and running and far superior to the previous site I
had.
Thank you John.&rdquo;</p><p><i>B. C., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 30th October
2014)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John was able to sort out various problems with my laptop, one
being a message for an update of Word 2010, which I thought may have
been a virus.
My laptop worked very slowly, and now after John has worked his magic it
is working much better.
I would recommend John to anyone who is having problems with their
computer.&rdquo;</p><p><i>S. B., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 24th October

Highly recommended.&rdquo;</p><p><i>D. M., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 20th October
2014)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Very prompt in visiting on time.
Diagnosed the problem very quickly and solved it on the spot.
What a change from so-called &lsquo;experts&rsquo; who need to take your
PC away!
Had a follow-up call to check all was good.
I would certainly recommend.&rdquo;</p><p><i>A. W., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 14th
October 2014)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;I phoned Mr. Wallis on a Friday evening about downloading printer
software from HP for Windows 8 upgraded to 8.1.
He promptly came to my home the following morning to help me.
He was very kind and professional.
I had told him about my problem over the phone the evening before.
He researched the problem that I was having and had discovered several
different solutions to the problem.
He was able to repair the printer issue promptly and thereafter helped me
with some minor issues that I did not know how to fix myself.
His fees were extremely reasonable.
I would highly recommend him for any computer issues.
I will call upon him again with any other issues that come up.&rdquo;</p><p><i>C. W., Barton Mills (Five-star rating awarded 14th
