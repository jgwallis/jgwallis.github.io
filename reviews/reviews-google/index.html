always given me and my husband excellent, prompt service.
His fees are very fair and he has never failed to fix any of our
problems.
In addition, he has always explained to us in plain language exactly
what caused every problem, and what he had to do to resolve it.&rdquo;</p><p><i>E. B., Mildenhall
(Five-star rating awarded 8th August 2020)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John has helped me on a couple of occasions when I have had
computer problems.
He has many years of experience and always manages to solve my
problems and explain what he does in a way that I can
understand without jargon.
He is very thorough and punctual and I found his charges very
reasonable.
I would definitely recommend John and give him five stars.&rdquo;</p><p><i>T. F., Mildenhall
(Five-star rating awarded 25th February 2019)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Excellent and fair computer engineer.
You will learn a lot from him as well as enjoying his expertise by solving
your problem.
Highly recommend him.&rdquo;</p><p><i>J. B., Barton Mills
(Five-star rating awarded 25th December 2018)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John was brilliant.
He installed my new printer.
Also put on a photo editing suite.
As well as this he made my Kindle so that I could use it again after two
years of being unable to get books to download to it instead of my
computer, after me changing my e-mail account.
Very pleased.&rdquo;</p><p><i>H. S., Mildenhall
(Five-star rating awarded 5th February 2017)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Excellent Service!
John repaired my three devices: a Mac, a HP notebook (Windows) and a
printer.
Excellent price for the required time.&rdquo;</p><p><i>F. M., Beck Row
(Five-star rating awarded 4th February 2017)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Having used John in the past when he provided an excellent service,
I emailed him with a problem I had attaching photos to an email.
He replied with a step-by-step guide as to how to solve the problem.
Working through John&rsquo;s guide, I sorted the problem and was able to
attach photos within minutes of following his instructions.
John is very polite, friendly, professional and extremely knowledgeable
and thoroughly deserving of a 5 star recommendation.&rdquo;</p><p><i>J. P., Lakenheath (Five-star rating awarded 28th June 2016)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;I would highly recommend the technical services of John Wallis.
In fact you would have to be absolutely bonkers not to use the experience
of John Wallis which is based upon long work experience with some of the
largest industry corporations when like me you needed to replace an
entire system, saving all useful data and at a very reasonable
cost.&rdquo;</p><p><i>J. A., Herringswell (Five-star rating awarded 19th October
2016)</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;John has helped us on a number of occasions and we have been very
pleased with his service.
His extensive knowledge is matched by his determination to solve the
problem which he has always achieved.
We would highly recommend him to you.&rdquo;</p><p><i>C. G., Mildenhall (Five-star rating awarded 31st March
