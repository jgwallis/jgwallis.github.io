for the first time.
This was no surprise to me, as I had recently had a taste of what TalkTalk
regard as customer service.
A client asked me for help after she had accidentally locked herself out
of her TalkTalk account by changing the password then forgetting it.
At first I tried going through the standard password reset procedure which
sent a &lsquo;reset e-mail&rsquo; to her registered e-mail account.
However, the customer had unfortunately changed her e-mail password at the
same time that she updated her TalkTalk account, and forgotten that as
well.
The TalkTalk website offered what was supposed to be an alternative method
of resetting the account password, but that just sent another &lsquo;reset
e-mail&rsquo; to the e-mail account that we could no longer access.</p><h2 id=locked-out-with-no-easy-way-in class=uk-h3>Locked out with no easy way in</h2><p>As we seemed to be locked out with no easy way of getting back in, we had
no alternative but to call TalkTalk customer service for help.
I explained that we had been through both of the password reset procedures
on the TalkTalk website, but each of them had simply sent us a
&lsquo;reset e-mail&rsquo; that we could not access.
I asked if we could simply answer some of the usual security questions on
the telephone so that TalkTalk could be sure that we were genuine.
After we had proved who we were, TalkTalk could safely reset the account
password for us.
Apparently that was not possible, though they had no answer when I asked
why not.
They insisted that the account password could only be changed by going
through the &lsquo;reset e-mail&rsquo; process.</p><h2 id=talktalks-brilliant-solution class=uk-h3>TalkTalk&rsquo;s stupid solution</h2><p>After a while, TalkTalk came up with a solution.
If we could set up another e-mail account somewhere else, they would send
a &lsquo;reset e-mail&rsquo; to our new e-mail address and we could use
that to get back into our TalkTalk account.
I was very surprised at this suggestion, and told them how daft it was.
Anyone could set up a new e-mail account this way, get TalkTalk to
send them a &lsquo;reset e-mail&rsquo;, then use it to hijack
someone else&rsquo;s account.
I reminded them that up to that point, they had not yet verified who we
really were.</p><h2 id=the-final-straw class=uk-h3>The final straw</h2><p>TalkTalk&rsquo;s security-breaching suggestion was the final straw
for my client.
Only a couple of weeks earlier I had helped her to negotiate a
two-year contract with TalkTalk, and they had already charged
her more than agreed on the first bill.
She was completely fed up, and promptly cancelled the contract,
which she was entitled to do within twenty days of entering
into it.
Within an hour of the cancellation I had helped the client
to sign up as a new customer with Plusnet, and now we are
just waiting for the switchover to happen on 7th May.</p><br></div></section><section class="uk-section uk-section-small"><div class="uk-container uk-container-small"><footer><div id=footer-container class="uk-container uk-container-small"><div uk-grid class="uk-child-width-expand@s uk-flex-middle uk-grid uk-text-center uk-text-small uk-visible@m jgw-footer"><div class="uk-width-1-2@m uk-text-left uk-first-column"><h5>Copyright &copy; J.
