computer to a new one when I had a sudden shock.
Some of the files had been encrypted by an infamous piece of ransomware
called CryptoLocker.
I immediately stopped what I was doing and started examining the old
computer to see if the malicious software was still operating.
If CryptoLocker was still active then it would be extremely important
to kill it off straight away to prevent it from causing any more
damage, but luckily it was no longer running.
The pressure was off, so I started trawling through the data to see
how many files had been affected.
Thankfully most files had not been touched, but quite a few important
documents and images had been encrypted.</p><h2 id=recovery-was-impossible class=uk-h3>Ransomware recovery was impossible</h2><p>The encrypted files were all dated 25th May 2015, so the damage had been
done several years ago rather than recently.
Each folder containing encrypted files also contained a plain text file
demanding a ransom to be paid in &lsquo;bitcoins&rsquo;, but the
deadline for payment was long gone, and even if there had still
been time, I would have advised my customer not to pay.
The backups that existed were no use, as they were simply copies of the
encrypted files, and the chances of decrypting the affected files
without the keys were almost zero.
Effectively, all the files that had been encrypted were lost.</p><h2 id=the-threat-was-ignored class=uk-h3>The ransomware threat was ignored</h2><p>I asked the customer if she&rsquo;d ever received an e-mail &lsquo;ransom
note&rsquo;, because the criminals behind the malicious software would
certainly have made an explicit threat, not just assumed that the
victim would find a threatening &lsquo;READ ME&rsquo; file somewhere
amongst their files.
It turned out that the customer always printed out every e-mail received,
and kept them forever, so she looked through the pile and sure enough,
there under &lsquo;25th May 2015&rsquo; was a threatening e-mail that
she had assumed was just an empty threat, even though it was real.</p><h2 id=guarding-against-ransomware class=uk-h3>Guarding against ransomware</h2><p>If you ever receive a threatening e-mail saying that some of your files
have been encrypted, the best thing to do is shut down your computer
straight away to prevent any further potential damage from being
done.
The next thing to do is start up the computer using a Linux live CD, DVD,
or USB flash drive, and see how many of your files have been affected.
If the threat is a hoax and your files have not actually been encrypted,
you can breathe a sigh of relief.
However, if some or all of your files have been encrypted, you will need
to recover the unencrypted versions from your regular backups.
The problem is that ransomware often does its worst then waits for a long
time before issuing a threat, in the hope that you&rsquo;ll have created
your usual backups by that time, and they&rsquo;ll all be encrypted too.</p><br></div></section><section class="uk-section uk-section-small"><div class="uk-container uk-container-small"><footer><div id=footer-container class="uk-container uk-container-small"><div uk-grid class="uk-child-width-expand@s uk-flex-middle uk-grid uk-text-center uk-text-small uk-visible@m jgw-footer"><div class="uk-width-1-2@m uk-text-left uk-first-column"><h5>Copyright &copy; J.
