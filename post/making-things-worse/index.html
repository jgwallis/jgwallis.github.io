<h2>
What have you done?!
</h2>
<p>
Will somebody please save me from &lsquo;helpful&rsquo; friends,
relatives, and neighbours?
They mean well, but once they&rsquo;ve messed up your computer and failed
to fix the original problem, they&rsquo;ll walk away and leave you in a
right state.
This recently happened yet again.
A lady whose system would for some reason no longer connect to the
Internet, using an Ethernet cable leading from the back of her
computer straight into a perfectly functioning BT Smart Hub 2,
rather than Wi-Fi, had some &lsquo;help&rsquo; from someone
who lived nearby.
This consisted of reinstalling Windows 10 Home version 1903, thankfully
while retaining all of her files.
Yes, the lady&rsquo;s documents and pictures were still there, but all of
the installed applications were removed during the reinstallation
process.
Norton AntiVirus, Google Chrome, Microsoft Word 2010, Adobe Reader, all
the printing and scanning software, etc., was completely wiped out at a
stroke, and the computer still wouldn&rsquo;t connect to the Internet
after all that.
Well, they&rsquo;d done their best, albeit to no avail, so it was time to
disappear and leave someone else to sort out the mess.
It would have been better if they&rsquo;d just called me in the first
place, but no, it seemed like a good idea at the time to just
&lsquo;have a go&rsquo; at fixing the problem (using a
sledgehammer to crack a nut), and now, several days
later, it was my turn.
</p>
<h2>
Windows 10 Home version 1903 was at fault
</h2>
<p>
I tried to find out what was going on by doing sensible tests.
Could I connect to the BT Smart Hub 2 using a laptop?
Yes it worked, so there was no problem with the hub&rsquo;s Wi-Fi or
broadband connection.
Could I connect using the customer&rsquo;s Ethernet cable instead?
Yes, so there was nothing wrong with the cable or the hub&rsquo;s
&lsquo;number 1&rsquo; Ethernet socket, which was the one that
the customer was trying to use.
I then tried to start up the customer&rsquo;s system using the &lsquo;Safe
Mode with Networking&rsquo; option.
That made no difference.
The connection was there, but Windows 10 said &lsquo;No Internet&rsquo;.
Removing then reinstalling all of the device drivers associated with the
Internet connection made no difference either, and nor did resetting all
the network components.
It all seemed to be a bit of a mystery.
Just to make absolutely sure that there was nothing wrong with the
hardware, I booted the computer from a USB flash memory device
containing Linux Mint.
That worked fine, as I suspected it would, and we were able to get onto
the Internet with no problem.
So Windows 10 Home version 1903 was the problem. No surprise there.
</p>
<h2>
Linux Mint looked interesting
</h2>
<p>
While I was running Linux Mint, the customer looked interested and asked
me exactly what it was.
I explained that it was an alternative to Windows that still had a
traditional desktop with icons, but underneath was completely
different, and in practice faster, more secure, convenient,
and reliable.
After running through all the advantages, including fast updates that were
optional, never took long, and rarely required the system to restart, the
customer asked if I couldn&rsquo;t just install Linux Mint and forget
about the broken Windows installation.
Well, yes, that would be simple.
However, I would need to back up all of her documents and photographs
first, so I could restore them all once the new system had been
installed.
She seemed happy with the prospect of having a stable system that
wouldn&rsquo;t fall apart at random times, leaving her in the
lurch, so I took away her tower system to do the work over
the next couple of days.
</p>
<h2>
Faster, safer, better
</h2>
<p>
After backing up the customer&rsquo;s data, I installed Linux Mint on the
tower system, happily wiping out Windows 10 in the process, and set up an
account for the customer.
The next step was to restore the customer&rsquo;s data into appropriate
folders, then download and install all the available updates, which was
a darn site quicker and simpler than applying Windows updates.
After that, it was simply a matter of making the icons and mouse pointer
larger than normal, as the customer&rsquo;s eyesight was not as good as
it used to be, and setting up shortcuts to her favoutite websites,
including the various card games that she liked to play online.
We then recovered her e-mail account, which she had not been able to
access for a while, and after that I wrote a couple of documents and
printed them out.
One explained how to start up the computer, log in, and finally shut the
computer down.
The other explained how to check for incoming e-mails, and send e-mails,
using Mozilla Thunderbird, which the customer took to immediately.
