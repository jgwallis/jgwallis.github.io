processor of their computer was regularly reaching 100&deg;C,
even when doing undemanding things such as viewing a text
file.
The business had a powerful water-cooled system that had been
custom-built for them by PCSpecialist.
The system was not very old, and had a durable motherboard, but
had already suffered from memory and hard drive failures.</p><h2>New thermal compound</h2><p>The overheating problem had been reported to PCSpecialist, and
they&rsquo;d sent the local software business a tube of
thermal compound for re-seating the water-cooler&rsquo;s
heatsink on top of the central processor.
However, the business really was strictly a software business,
and the owner was not comfortable working on hardware, which
was why he asked me to help.
As the problem was urgent, I agreed to look at the system
straight away.</p><h2>Basic cooling system checks</h2><p>When I arrived on site the customer demonstrated the overheating problem,
and the central processor temperature was a serious concern.
It was a very hot day, but the cooling system should have been working
much better than it was.
The radiator fan was working as expected, and the radiator fins were
completely free of dust.
The water-cooled heatsink itself was plugged into the same 12V DC power
source as the radiator fan, so the circulating pump had power.</p><h2>The heatsink was not installed properly</h2><p>After those basic checks, I unclamped the water-cooled heatsink from the
top of the central processor.
The next step was to wipe the old thermal compound from the bottom of
the water-cooled heatsink and the top of the central processor.
Once the old thermal compound was removed, the customer and I were both
flabbergasted to see a plastic label stuck on the copper bottom of the
water-cooled heatsink saying ‘Warning! Remove Before Installation!’</p><h2>Installing the heatsink properly</h2><p>The people at PCSpecialist had taken no notice of the warning label, and
had simply left it in place, reducing the thermal conductivity between
the central processor and the water-cooled heatsink to an unknown
degree.
After removing the warning label and cleaning the top of the central
processor with a solvent to remove every trace of thermal compound,
I applied the new thermal compound and re-clamped the water-cooled
heatsink on top of the central processor.</p><h2>Cooling system still inefficient</h2><p>After restarting the system we&rsquo;d hoped to see a significant decrease
in the central processor&rsquo;s temperature when the system was under
load, but it was still overheating to almost the same degree as
before.
However, it was possible that the water circulation pump was still not
working properly.
Also the small channels within the water-cooled heatsink could have
been clogged up with contaminants.</p><h2>Never void any warranty</h2><p>I refrained from taking the water pump apart as it would have voided any
warranty that might still be in force, and been too messy to carry out
on site (the system was too important to take away for off-site
investigation).
However, given the reliability of some of the other components that were
originally fitted to the system, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprising
to find that the cooling pump was at fault.</p><h2>Poor cooling and premature component failure</h2><p>Before I left, the customer said that he&rsquo;d get in touch with
PCSpecialist to let them know that they&rsquo;d failed to remove
the protective plastic sheet at the bottom of the
water-cooled heatsink, and ask what they intended
to do next.
Because of their mistake, the system must&rsquo;ve been running
hotter than it should&rsquo;ve been ever since it was brand
new, possibly contributing to premature component failures.</p><br></div></section><section class="uk-section uk-section-small"><div class="uk-container uk-container-small"><footer><div id=footer-container class="uk-container uk-container-small"><div uk-grid class="uk-child-width-expand@s uk-flex-middle uk-grid uk-text-center uk-text-small uk-visible@m jgw-footer"><div class="uk-width-1-2@m uk-text-left uk-first-column"><h5>Copyright &copy; J.
