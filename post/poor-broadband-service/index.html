you&rsquo;d get speeds of &lsquo;up to 8 Mbps&rsquo;.
However, there were lots of speeds on the way up to 8 Mbps, such as 1 Mbps
for example!
If your &lsquo;up to 8 Mbps&rsquo; speed was actually 1 Mbps, you&rsquo;d
have a hard time watching online video, or doing anything else that
needed a reasonable line speed.
Some time ago, the Government told the broadband service providers to
stop all this &lsquo;up to&rsquo; nonsense and use accurate speeds in
their marketing and advertising material.
However, a lot of customers in rural areas are still getting very low line
speeds despite all the network upgrading that&rsquo;s supposed to be
happening.</p><h2 id=a-recent-poor-broadband-case class=uk-h3>A recent poor broadband case</h2><p>I recently visited a customer who was only getting a broadband speed of
about 0.15 Mbps, even though she lived very near the main telephone
exchange and should really have been getting a much faster speed.
The first step was to test the line after isolating all the extension
wiring, though this made no difference and the speed was still
atrocious.
The second step was to replace the customer&rsquo;s ancient broadband
modem with a new wireless router, so she requested one by sending a
message to the service provider via their website.
Needless to say, the message was ignored, but after a few days the
customer telephoned to ask for a new router, and it eventually
arrived.</p><h2 id=new-router-not-set-up class=uk-h3>The new router wasn&rsquo;t set up properly</h2><p>When the new router arrived, it came with a sheet of instructions showing
how to set up the wiring, but there wasn&rsquo;t any explanation of how
to get the router to log on to the telephone exchange.
Another problem was that although the router had a label on the bottom
saying what the wireless password was, it turned out to be completely
wrong!
Anyway, after the new device was set up properly, the line speed was still
only 0.15 Mbps.
Reluctantly, the logical third step was to telephone the broadband
customer support people, though I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to
it.</p><h2 id=telephoning-broadband-customer-support class=uk-h3>Telephoning broadband customer support</h2><p>After being authorised by the customer to speak on her behalf, I started
to explain to the broadband support person that the line speed was only
0.15 Mbps according to &lsquo;speedtest.net&rsquo;, but they refused to
accept that figure and said that I had to take several speed readings
over the next few days using &lsquo;supportal-test.co.uk&rsquo;
before they&rsquo;d take any action.
I went to the suggested website, but all I found there was a blank page.
The support person said that something might eventually appear there if
I just kept trying, but that&rsquo;s when I started to get a little bit
angry.</p><h2 id=the-squeaky-wheel-gets-the-grease class=uk-h3>The squeaky wheel gets the grease</h2><p>After half an hour of arguing with the support person, who constantly
talked over me, I managed to persuade them to check the line
configuration at the telephone exchange.
There was, the support person said, one thing they could try.
&lsquo;Alright,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;try it then.&rsquo;
A few minutes later the line speed went up to over 12 Mbps, which just
went to show that it was a simple problem all the time that could
easily have been fixed without sending out a BT Openreach
engineer or causing me a lot of stress.
It just goes to show that if your broadband service provider turns out
to be obstructive, it pays to be tenacious.</p><br></div></section><section class="uk-section uk-section-small"><div class="uk-container uk-container-small"><footer><div id=footer-container class="uk-container uk-container-small"><div uk-grid class="uk-child-width-expand@s uk-flex-middle uk-grid uk-text-center uk-text-small uk-visible@m jgw-footer"><div class="uk-width-1-2@m uk-text-left uk-first-column"><h5>Copyright &copy; J.
