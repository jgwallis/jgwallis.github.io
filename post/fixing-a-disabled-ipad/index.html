urge to keep guessing.
If you keep going for long enough then the iPad will eventually be
disabled, and the way out of that can be complicated.
The idea is that stolen iPads are of no use to thieves, so there&rsquo;s
no incentive to steal them.
However, people who are not very familiar with computers can find it
difficult to follow all the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; and end up getting
locked out of devices that they legally own.</p><h2 id=dont-keep-guessing-passcodes class=uk-h3>Don&rsquo;t keep guessing passcodes</h2><p>I was recently asked to fix a disabled iPad for a customer who
hadn&rsquo;t used it for a very long time, and as a result had
forgotten the passcode.
Unfortunately she had repeatedly tried to remember it, without success,
and ended up with the iPad being disabled.
After being handed a piece of paper with some account names and passwords
written on it, I was able to log in to the customer&rsquo;s iCloud
account.
However, no Apple devices were registered to that account, so it was not
possible to use the &lsquo;Find My Device&rsquo; facility.</p><h2 id=nothings-ever-easy class=uk-h3>Nothing&rsquo;s ever easy</h2><p>When an iPad has been disabled, a message saying so appears on the screen,
along with a suggestion that you connect the device to Apple&rsquo;s
iTunes software, which is used for all kinds of purposes, not just
music.
One of the things that you can do with iTunes is restore a disabled iPad
to normal operation.
This should be simple, but of course isn&rsquo;t.
It ought to be possible to connect the disabled iPad to iTunes, go onto
the Internet with iTunes, prove that you own the iPad, and let
Apple&rsquo;s security systems re-enable the device.
However, the procedure is unfortunately much more painful than that.</p><h2 id=forced-to-upgrade class=uk-h3>Forced to upgrade</h2><p>First you have to start up the disabled iPad in a special recovery mode.
Apple&rsquo;s instructions for doing this aren&rsquo;t at all clear, but
with luck you can eventually find out how to do it for your
specific device from online forums.
The next step is to start iTunes, which will see that the iPad is in
recovery mode and offer to upgrade or reset it.
Even if you choose the reset option, iTunes will still insist on
upgrading the iPad&rsquo;s operating system (iOS) as part of the
process.
The last thing you need when trying to recover from a problem is to be
forced to do extra tasks that aren&rsquo;t strictly necessary.</p><h2 id=itunes-download-moronic class=uk-h3>The iTunes download process is moronic</h2><p>Anyway, the next thing that happens is iTunes will start downloading an
entire new pile of software for the iPad.
In my case this was 1.8 GB in size and there was no way it was going to
download successfully in one go.
To see exactly how the download mechanism worked, I asked to pause it
after a few minutes, with a view to then resuming.
It&rsquo;s just as well I did this experiment, because when I tried to
carry on with the download it just started all over again from
scratch.
I&rsquo;ve seen some stupid software in my time, but this was ridiculous.
Surely Apple must have realised how absurd this was.</p><h2 id=itunes-software-source class=uk-h3>Where was iTunes finding the new software?</h2><p>All I wanted to do was enable the iPad, but now I was being forced into
finding a devious way to get the iPad software downloaded.
Thankfully I found a website at &lsquo;ipsw.me&rsquo; that had a lot of
iOS software versions available for download, including iOS 10.3.3 that
I needed.
The website didn&rsquo;t host all the available versions of Apple
software, it just re-directed me to the appropriate Apple server.
Therefore I was downloading official Apple software, not software that
might have been adulterated.</p><h2 id=alternative-download-method class=uk-h3>An alternative downloading method</h2><p>Anyway, now I had to find a sensible way of downloading the software
that I needed.
There were plenty of download manager programs available, and I chose to
use a simple one called uGet, which downloaded what I needed in a few
attempts.
Whenever the download froze, I took a break and carried on later.
Eventually I had the 1.8 GB file that I needed, containing iOS 10.3.3,
despite the fact thay my Internet connection was not particularly fast
or reliable.</p><h2 id=resetting-the-ipad class=uk-h3>Resetting the disabled iPad</h2><p>The next step was to use iTunes to load the iOS software onto the iPad
then verify the installation with Apple.
Clicking the iTunes &lsquo;restore&rsquo; button would simply start the
broken downloading process again, but holding down the Shift key while
clicking the &lsquo;restore&rsquo; button provide the opportunity to
load the iPad with software from an existing file (in my case called
&lsquo;iPad_32bit_10.3.3_14G60_Restore.ipsw&rsquo;).
After doing this, and waiting for a few minutes, the iPad was finally
working again and said &lsquo;Hello&rsquo;.
The only thing I had to do then was set it up for the customer as if
it were brand new.</p><br></div></section><section class="uk-section uk-section-small"><div class="uk-container uk-container-small"><footer><div id=footer-container class="uk-container uk-container-small"><div uk-grid class="uk-child-width-expand@s uk-flex-middle uk-grid uk-text-center uk-text-small uk-visible@m jgw-footer"><div class="uk-width-1-2@m uk-text-left uk-first-column"><h5>Copyright &copy; J.
