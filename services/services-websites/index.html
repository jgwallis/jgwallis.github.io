the resulting material to a web server that would make it available to
anyone who asked to look at it.
Very early websites were built by hand, but later many programs became
available to make the process easier.
These programs looked like desktop publishing programs, except the results
weren&rsquo;t published in print, they were published on the web.
However, after a while everything got more complicated.</p><h3>&lsquo;Dynamic&rsquo; websites</h3><p>Early websites were &lsquo;static&rsquo; because they couldn&rsquo;t
display information that changed minute by minute, such as the stock
levels in an online shop for example.
However, many people building websites wanted &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo;
behaviour with web pages that could display constantly changing
information.
The way they achieved this was by using database systems that held a
mixture of web page templates and live data.
Whenever someone requested a particular web page, software running on the
web server would fill in the appropriate template with live data and
create a page that reflected the state of play at that time.</p><h3>Anyone could edit a &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo; website</h3><p>With a database system it meant that anyone, not just a web developer,
could log on to a web server and put fresh information, such as a
news article for example, into the database.
A journalist writing such a news article wouldn&rsquo;t have to understand
anything about web page templates.
All they had to do was type in their article, and it would immediately
become visible on the website.</p><h3>The catch(es)</h3><p>Unfortunately there are some disadvantages to &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo;
websites, which compared with &lsquo;static&rsquo; websites are:</p><ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet"><li>slower, because the web server has to build web pages from bits and
pieces stored in the database rather than just handing out
ready-built pages on request;</li><li>less secure, because databases can be hacked much more easily than
simple web pages;</li><li>harder to &lsquo;back up&rsquo;, because it&rsquo;s necessary to create
a copy of the database in which the website is stored, rather than just
a few files on a PC;</li><li>easier to damage, because all it takes is one slip-up when editing in a
&lsquo;live&rsquo; environment and people will be able to see your
mistake straight away;</li><li>more awkward to test, as setting up a local testing environment that is
completely separate from the &lsquo;live&rsquo; site is not simple;</li><li>difficult to manage using &lsquo;version control&rsquo;, which is a way
of tracking changes to the website so you can see who made them, what
they were, and when they happened, enabling them to be reversed if
required;</li><li>sometimes relatively expensive to host, because they require
significantly more resources and facilities;</li><li>quite time-consuming in terms of house-keeping, because database systems
and content management systems have to be updated every time security
flaws are identified; and</li><li>more difficult to move to a new host, if for some reason you get fed up
with your current host.</li></ul><h3>Back to &lsquo;static&rsquo; websites</h3><p>The most popular system for building &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo; websites is
called WordPress.
There are plenty of similar systems as well, such as Drupal and Joomla
for example.
None of these systems is going away any time soon.
However, for many kinds of website, using a large and complicated content
management system like WordPress is way over-the-top.
For this reason, many web developers are going back to the original way
of creating websites, the &lsquo;static&rsquo; way, and I&rsquo;m one
of them.
They are particularly suitable for small business websites, which is
what most of my web development work involves.
The website you are looking at now is a static website.
This doesn&lsquo;t mean that nothing can change, or that every page just
consists of text and images that sit there and do nothing.
It simply means that every page on the website is built before being put
on the web server that hosts the website, so the web server never has to
do anything &lsquo;clever&rsquo; and just has to hand out ready-made
pages on demand.</p><h3>Editing a &lsquo;static&rsquo; website</h3><p>It&rsquo;s not quite as easy to edit a &lsquo;static&rsquo; website as it
is to edit a &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo; website, but anyone can learn to do
it.
Unfortunately there aren&rsquo;t many programs available to help manage a
&lsquo;static&rsquo; website, so I wrote one.
The program isn&rsquo;t complicated, and doesn&rsquo;t do very much, but
it helps to speed things up and reduces many website maintenance tasks
to simple button-clicking, which cuts down the number of things you
have to remember.
However, it&rsquo;s possible to do everything manually, as described
below.</p><h2>Main software</h2><p>You can build a modern static website using just three main pieces of
software:</p><ol><li>Hugo &ndash; a program that combines web page templates with text files
and images to create web pages.</li><li>UIkit &ndash; a user interface framework that gives web pages a nice
appearance without very much work.</li><li>Sass &ndash; a program that lets you change the look of your web pages
from the basic UIkit appearance.</li></ol><p>Please note that if you&rsquo;re making simple changes to a website
that&rsquo;s already been designed, you can ignore UIkit and Sass
completely.
All you need to do is change the existing content however you want, then
re-build and re-publish the website with Hugo.</p><h2>Other software</h2><p>Obviously some other software is involved:</p><ol><li>You&rsquo;ll definitely need some nice file-editing software to make
changes to text files.
I use the excellent Notepad++ program, which is freely available from
<a title="Click to find out about Notepad++" href=https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>https://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a>
and very easy to use.</li><li>If you want to create or alter photograph-like images, you&rsquo;ll
probably need a decent image-editing program such as GIMP.
This is a free program that you can download from
<a title="Click to find out about GIMP" href=https://www.gimp.org/>https://www.gimp.org/</a>.
It&rsquo;s powerful, but not particularly easy to use.</li><li>You might also need a nice illustration program for drawing logos,
diagrams, and so on.
A good free one is Inkscape, which you can get from
<a title="Click to find out about Inkscape" href=https://inkscape.org/>https://inkscape.org/</a>.</li><li>For producing sophisticated 3D graphics, you could try your hand at
using Blender, which is quite complex.
I&rsquo;ve been using it for years, but still don&rsquo;t know how all
the different features work.
You can download it free from
<a title="Click to find out about Blender" href=https://www.blender.org/>https://www.blender.org/</a>.</li></ol><p>If the graphics programs mentioned above are a bit much, you can just get
ordinary photographs from your mobile telephone or camera and put them
straight onto your website.
You&rsquo;d better make sure they&rsquo;re not too big though, because
large images take ages to load and people soon get fed up if you make
them wait.
Hugo actually has a built-in facility for shrinking images when it&rsquo;s
building a website.</p><h2>Hugo</h2><h3>Getting the software</h3><p>Hugo is probably the fastest website builder in the world, which is one of
the main reasons that its popularity is rising all the time.
You can find out all about it at
<a title="Click to find out about Hugo" href=https://gohugo.io/>https://gohugo.io/</a>.
Then you can download the latest release from
<a title="Click to find out about the latest release of Hugo" href=https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/>https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/</a>.
Some of the Hugo documentation can be very confusing, but you don&rsquo;t
have to understand most of it if you&rsquo;re just updating an existing
website.
There are versions of Hugo for various different systems, such as Linux
and Windows for example, and for each system you can get either the
32-bit version or the 64-bit version.</p><h3>32-bit or 64-bit?</h3><p>Are you confused about 32-bit and 64-bit systems?
Never mind, you don&rsquo;t really need to know what these terms mean.
All you need to know is that 32-bit versions of Hugo will work on 64-bit
systems, but 64-bit versions of Hugo won&rsquo;t work on 32-bit systems.
Therefore, if you don&rsquo;t know whether your system is 32-bit or
64-bit, download the 32-bit version and it&rsquo;ll definitely
work.
Having said that, if you&rsquo;re using a modern version of Windows,
it&rsquo;ll almost certainly be a 64-bit version.</p><h3>Old-fashioned interface</h3><p>Hugo has no modern user interface, because it doesn&rsquo;t really need
one.
It runs from the command prompt.
Once the program has been installed, typing &lsquo;hugo&rsquo; at a
command prompt will make the program run, though usually you&rsquo;ll
need to type a bit more than that.
To make changes to an existing static website, all you need is a simple
text file editor to alter the website&rsquo;s content, and Hugo to
re-build the website.
There will be step-by-step examples.</p><h3>Building a Hugo website for publication</h3><ol><li>Open a command prompt.</li><li>Move into the website&rsquo;s main folder using the &lsquo;cd&rsquo;
(change directory) command.</li><li>Type &lsquo;hugo&rsquo;.</li><li>Hugo will read the &lsquo;config.toml&rsquo; file, build the website,
and put the result in a folder named &lsquo;public&rsquo;.</li></ol><h2>Website structure</h2><p>An entire website will be held in a single folder, which will have a
standardised name indicating what it contains.
For example, my own website is held in a folder named ‘JGW-Website’,
because my initials are JGW.
Throughout the following explanations, I will use my own website to
show how everything works.</p><p>Within the website folder you will find at least the following three
things:</p><ol><li>A folder called &lsquo;content&rsquo;.</li><li>A folder called &lsquo;themes&rsquo;.</li><li>A file called &lsquo;config.toml&rsquo;.</li></ol><p>You might also find other files, such as &lsquo;notes.txt&rsquo; for
example, but such files do not have any effect on the website.
All they do is contain information that might be useful for people
maintaining the website.</p><h3>The &lsquo;content&rsquo; folder</h3><p>If you want to change the content of a website, you will usually find it
in the &lsquo;content&rsquo; folder.
All websites have a &lsquo;home&rsquo; page, which is often different
from the other pages on a website, and is normally held in a file
called &lsquo;_index.html&rsquo; inside the &lsquo;content&rsquo;
folder.
Most websites also have an &lsquo;about&rsquo; page, a &lsquo;legal&rsquo;
page, a &lsquo;contact&rsquo; page, and so on.
These pages are usually held in folders of their own within the
&lsquo;content&rsquo; folder.
For example, the &lsquo;about&rsquo; page will usually be found in a file
named &lsquo;_index.html&rsquo; inside the &lsquo;about&rsquo; folder
which is itself inside the &lsquo;content&rsquo; folder.</p><p>Although it is possible to build websites using MarkDown files (whose
names end with &lsquo;.md&rsquo;), I use HTML files (whose names end
with &lsquo;.html&rsquo;).
MarkDown is supposed to be easier to use than HTML, but a lot of the
HTML facilities that I use are not available in MarkDown.
Also, HTML is an international standard language for building web pages,
whereas MarkDown is available in several different versions, none of
which is of much help as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p><p>In summary, if you want to change the &lsquo;about&rsquo; page then you
just need to use a text editing program on the file named
&lsquo;content/about/_index.html&rsquo;.
If you don&rsquo;t know much about HTML you can always copy bits and
pieces that already exist and change those copies however you like.
For example, an HTML paragraph starts with &lsquo;&lt;p>&rsquo; and
ends with &lsquo;&lt;/p>&rsquo;.
If you want to add a new paragraph to the &lsquo;about&rsquo; page there
will already be plenty of examples in the file you are editing.
All you need to do is copy an existing paragraph then change the text.</p><h3>The &lsquo;themes&rsquo; folder</h3><p>Unless you are completely re-designing the website, you can more or less
ignore the &lsquo;themes&rsquo; folder.</p><h3>The &lsquo;config.toml&rsquo; file</h3><p>This is the configuration file for the website.
Configuration files can be in several different formats, but all of the
websites that I&rsquo;ve been involved with use the &lsquo;.toml&rsquo;
(&lsquo;Tom&rsquo;s Obvious Markup Language&rsquo;) format.</p><h2>Website deployment</h2><p>Once you&rsquo;ve built the website in the &lsquo;public&rsquo; folder,
you need to publish it on the Internet.
In other words you have to put it on a web server so that any Internet
user can see it using a web browser.
Website developers refer to this process as &lsquo;deployment&rsquo;.
Different web hosts often use similar software, but the exact details of
how to deploy a website on a particular web host&lsquo;s server will
often be specific to that host.
Most web hosts support an old-fashioned method of transferring files from
your computer onto their server(s) using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
They will probably also support a popular control panel facility called
&lsquo;cPanel&rsquo;, which supports the uploading of files.
A less common facility that is very easy to use, once set up, is called
&lsquo;WebDav&rsquo;, which was originally designed to support multiple
authors working together on a document.</p><br></div></section><div class=uk-container><section class="uk-section uk-section-small uk-background-cover uk-background-center-center"><footer><div id=footer-container class="uk-container uk-container-small"><div uk-grid class="uk-child-width-expand@s uk-flex-middle uk-grid uk-text-center uk-text-small uk-visible@m jgw-footer"><div class="uk-width-1-2@m uk-text-left uk-first-column"><h5>Copyright &copy; 2021 J.
